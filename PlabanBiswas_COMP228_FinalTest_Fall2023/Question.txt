FINAL TEST - Final

Student: ______________________

Be sure to read the following general instructions carefully:
-	This lab test must be completed individually by all the students.
-	You should submit the entire project through dropbox link on eCentennial immediately after demonstration.
-	Submit a mute video of running your solution (simple video up to five minutes), The video shows the following:
1.	Show your name and ID using a text file.
2.	Scrolling your code on-screen slowly, this code should be compatible with the submitted project.
3.	Show the results as required.

Exercise 1

Start a new IntelliJ Java project. Name the project: YourFullName_COMP228_FinalTest_Fall2023. For example: JohnSmith_COMP228_FinalTest_Fall2023. DO NOT create a package in this project.

Write a GUI application in Java that allows user to select students by their city.

The user should be able to enter the city. The application should retrieve the student information from an Oracle table named Student. Here is the definition of the table:
CREATE TABLE Students (
   studentID char(9) NOT NULL,
   firstName varchar (20) NOT NULL,
   lastName varchar (20) NOT NULL,
   address varchar (30) NOT NULL,
   city varchar(30) NOT NULL,
   province char(2) NOT NULL,
   postalCode char(6) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (studentID)
);
Populate the table with several rows as below:
insert into Students values('300111222','Sam', 'Malone', '10 Somewhere Road', 'Toronto','ON','M1Y2H2');
commit;

The information should be displayed in a JTextArea component which has scrolling abilities. Use “\t” and “\n” to format the display.

Use the most appropriate layout manager classes to implement the layout of this GUI.													(100 marks)

Evaluation:

Correct implementation of data access using JDBC (connecting with server, executing a prepared statement, displaying results) 		50%
Comments, correct naming of variables, methods, classes, etc.	5%

Friendly input/output	10%
Total	100%
