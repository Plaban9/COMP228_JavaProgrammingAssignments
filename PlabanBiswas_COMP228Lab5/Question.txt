COMP 228: Java Programming
LAB #5 - Developing Database Applications using JDBC.


Student: ______________________________________________________________________

Due Date:	Week 12.

Purpose:	The purpose of this Lab assignment is to:
•	Practice JDBC in Java Applications
•	Develop a GUI Java application with data access capabilities
References:	Read the textbook, ppt slides, and consult references (if any).
This material provides the necessary information you need to complete the exercises.
Be sure to read the following general instructions carefully:

•	Students can work in pairs for this assignment using pair programming technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
-	You will have to demonstrate your solution in a scheduled lab session and submitting the code through dropbox link on eCentennial.

•	You must name your Eclipse project according to the following rule:
YourFullName_COMP228Labnumber
Example: JohSmith_COMP228Lab2

•	Submit your assignment in a zip file that is named according to the following rule: YourLastName_COMP228Labnumber.zip
Example: JohSmith_COMP228Lab2.zip

•	Submit a mute video of running your solution (simple video up to five minutes), The video shows the following:
1.	Show your name and ID using a text file.
2.	Scrolling your code on-screen slowly, this code should be compatible with the submitted project.
3.	Show the results as required.

•	Apply the naming conventions for variables, methods, classes, and packages:
a.	variable names start with a lowercase character
b.	classes start with an uppercase character
c.	packages use only lowercase characters
d.	methods start with a lowercase character


Penalties Policies:
1.	The assignment did not meet the instructions above faces a 20% penalty.
2.	Late assignments will be accepted for 2 days after the due date has passed.
Assignments will not be accepted past the 2 days limit.
3.	Late assignments face a 35% penalty, 15% for the first day and 20% for the second day

Exercise 1:

Develop a GUI Java application that will allow the players to submit information about themselves and the games that they are playing on-line. The information will be stored in a simple Oracle database. The database tables are shown in the following picture:



You can use SQL Developer to create your database in Oracle server.

You should populate the table Game with titles of games that you have "played" during this semester.

Your GUI should provide the necessary SWING or JavaFX components that will allow the user to enter and display the data. You will use JDBC to provide the following operations:
1.	Insert game and player information into the database.
2.	Update the existing player information.
3.	Display reports with player and played games information. You may use a JTable or other components to display the reports. Allow the user to select player_id.

Use prepared statements to implement all database operations.
